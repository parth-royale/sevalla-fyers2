Key Elements for a Graceful Shutdown
Global WebSocket Client Object (ws_client):
By saving the WebSocket client instance in a global variable, your shutdown function (e.g. stop_main()) can call methods (such as disconnect() or close()) on it. Without a global reference, the stop function would have no way to signal the blocking call to exit.

Stop Event (ws_stop_event):
A threading.Event is used to signal the WebSocket thread that it should stop. In your ws_client_connect() function, you wrap the blocking call inside a loop that checks if the event is set. When ws_stop_event.set() is called (for example, in stop_main()), the thread should eventually notice that the event is set and exit its loop.

Thread Reference (ws_thread):
Keeping a reference to the thread lets you call join() later so that you can wait for the thread to finish its shutdown process. This is important if you need to coordinate a clean shutdown.

The Shutdown Function (stop_main()):
In your stop_main(), you set the stop event and then call a method (such as ws_client.disconnect()) to try to break out of the blocking connect() call. Finally, you join the thread to ensure it has terminated.

Below are the key changes made to your base application to enable a graceful shutdown via the stop_main() function using the Fyers WebSocket client:

Global WebSocket Client Object (ws_client):

What Changed:
You store the Fyers WebSocket client instance in a global variable (ws_client).
Why It’s Needed:
This allows the stop_main() function to call methods like close_connection() on the active WebSocket client, so the blocking connection can be interrupted and shut down.
Dedicated Shutdown Function (stop_main()):

What Changed:
A new function, stop_main(), is defined to handle the shutdown process.
Why It’s Needed:
This function is scheduled via APScheduler to be called at a specified time. It calls ws_client.close_connection(), which stops the WebSocket connection, cleans up internal threads, and allows the connection to terminate gracefully.
Scheduler Integration:

What Changed:
APScheduler is added to the application to schedule when to start (main()) and stop (stop_main()) the WebSocket connection.
Why It’s Needed:
Instead of letting the connection run indefinitely, the scheduler triggers stop_main() at a preset time (e.g., 13:03 IST), ensuring the connection is closed as desired.
Running the Connection in Its Own Thread (Optional):

What Changed:
The WebSocket client is started in its own thread using threading.Thread(target=ws_client_connect, daemon=True).start().
Why It’s Needed:
This isolates the blocking connection process from the main Flask server so that the server remains responsive while the connection runs. It also allows the shutdown function to join the thread (if needed) to ensure a clean exit.
Summary:

The global ws_client lets stop_main() access the WebSocket instance and call its close_connection() method.
A dedicated shutdown function (stop_main()) is added, which is triggered by a scheduler job to close the connection at a specific time.
The connection is run in a separate thread, so the main Flask server stays responsive, and the scheduler can later signal for a graceful shutdown.
These changes collectively transform the base app from one that runs indefinitely to one that can be externally stopped at a scheduled time without abruptly killing the thread.
